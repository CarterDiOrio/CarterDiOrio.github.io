The ChArUco board provided the\nmovement in the camera frame and then the average translation errors where found by comparing the expected and actual camera motion using the Hand Eye transform. It\nachieved a mean translational error of 1.7 millimeters and a mean rotational error of 0.37 degrees. To compare this against an industry solution, Zivid an industrial 3D\ncamera manufacturer, provides a target based hand eye calibration solution and this targetless solution exceeds it in rotational accuracy while falling slightly behind\nin translation accuracy (See Zivid Results here: https://blog.zivid.com/importance-of-3d-hand-eye-calibration)"),"\n",i.createElement("div",{style:{maxWidth:"800px",margin:"auto",display:"flex",justifyContent:"center",alignItems:"center"}},i.createElement("video",{autoPlay:!0,loop:!0,muted:!0,playsInline:!0,controls:!0,style:{maxHeight:"400px"}},i.createElement("source",{src:"/robot_arm_testing.mp4",type:"video/mp4"}))),"\n",i.createElement(t.h2,{id:"citations",style:{position:"relative"}},i.createElement(t.a,{href:"#citations","aria-label":"citations permalink",className:"anchor before"},i.createElement(t.span,{dangerouslySetInnerHTML:{__html:'<svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg>'}})),"Citations"),"\n",i.createElement(t.ol,null,"\n",i.createElement(t.li,null,"Enebuse I, Ibrahim BKSMK, Foo M, Matharu RS, Ahmed H.
